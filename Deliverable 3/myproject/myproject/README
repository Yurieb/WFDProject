CaseKart â€“ Retail Customer Support

A focused, no-nonsense support system tailored for retail clients

Overview:
CaseKart is a web-based customer support tool built with Django. It allows customers to report issues, agents to respond to them, and managers to oversee the process. It was created as a college project to demonstrate how user roles, permissions, and communication workflows can be handled in a real system.

Customer: Submit a case from the homepage. After an agent replies, come back and leave feedback.

Agent: View assigned cases and write a response. The case will close automatically.

Manager: Open the dashboard and assign open cases to agents.



What is tested:
Case Submission
Verifies that a logged-in customer can submit a new support case successfully.

Agent Assignment
Checks that a manager can assign an agent to an open support case using the dashboard.

Case Response by Agent
Confirms that when an agent responds to a case, the system records the response and automatically marks the case as "closed".

Customer Feedback
Ensures that customers can leave feedback (rating and comments) after the case is closed.
